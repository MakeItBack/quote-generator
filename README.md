# Quote Generator

## Getting Started

Install required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes on usage

- Select the pricelist or discount structure from the dropdown
- Changing the pricelist re-sets the checkout
- To start a new quote either refresh the browser or select a new pricelist

## Ideas for improvements

- Can do something special with discounts for 'add-ons' as a category rather than one-by one. I built the product data structure to identify add-ons so they could be filtered out if this was thought to be valuable.
- Make the IDs more unique
- Error handling - display for user
- Tests to automatically run scenarios
